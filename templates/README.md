# Vibe MD Templates

A comprehensive collection of Markdown templates designed to streamline AI-assisted software development workflows. These templates provide structured documentation frameworks that help both developers and AI assistants understand project requirements, architecture, and implementation strategies.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository contains a set of interconnected Markdown templates that serve as context files for AI development assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). The templates are designed to:

- **Standardize project documentation** across different development scenarios
- **Enable autonomous AI development** by providing clear context and constraints
- **Facilitate consistent project setup** for students and indie developers
- **Support both local and cloud-based applications** with appropriate templates

## üìÅ Template Structure

Each template serves a specific purpose in the development workflow:

| File | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| `claude.md` | Master context file with conflict resolution rules | High |
| `prd.md` | Product Requirements Document - features and goals | High |
| `infra.md` | Infrastructure and technical foundation | High |
| `workflow.md` | Development workflow and execution process | High |
| `security.md` | Security requirements and best practices | Medium |
| `sbom.md` | Software Bill of Materials - approved dependencies | Medium |
| `tests.md` | Testing strategy and frameworks | Low |
| `changelog.md` | Version history and change tracking | Low |
| `first_prompt.md` | Interactive setup guide for populating templates | Utility |

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Copy the templates** to your new project directory
3. **Run the interactive setup** by following the `first_prompt.md` guide
4. **Customize each template** with your project-specific information
5. **Use with your AI assistant** to build your application

### Example Usage

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app

# Copy the templates
cp /path/to/vibe-md-templates/*.md .

# Follow the first_prompt.md guide to populate the templates
# Then use with your AI assistant to build your app
```

## üé® Template Features

### Conflict Resolution System
The templates include a sophisticated conflict resolution matrix that ensures AI assistants make consistent decisions when different documentation sources conflict.

### Technology Agnostic
Templates work with any programming language or framework:
- **Local Applications**: Python scripts, desktop apps, CLI tools
- **Web Applications**: Next.js, React, Vue, vanilla JavaScript
- **Mobile Applications**: React Native, Flutter, native development
- **Backend Services**: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust

### Security-First Approach
Built-in security considerations and best practices for:
- Secret management
- Dependency security
- Authentication and authorization
- Data sensitivity classification

## üìã Template Details

### Core Templates (Required)

**`claude.md`** - The master context file that:
- Lists all required context files
- Defines conflict resolution precedence
- Establishes global project conventions

**`prd.md`** - Product Requirements Document that captures:

- Feature specifications
- UI/UX requirements
- Scope limitations

**`infra.md`** - Infrastructure documentation covering:
- Technology stack and frameworks
- Development environment setup
- Deployment architecture
- Data storage strategies

**`workflow.md`** - Development process that defines:
- Plan creation and execution
- Git commit workflows
- Self-optimization routines
- Error handling procedures

### Supporting Templates (Recommended)

**`security.md`** - Security framework including:
- Data sensitivity classification
- Authentication methods
- Dependency security policies
- Secrets management
