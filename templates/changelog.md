## Version Numbering Rules

We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** for all projects:

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Incompatible or breaking changes.
- **MINOR (0.X.0):** New features added in a backwards-compatible way.
- **PATCH (0.0.X):** Bug fixes or small improvements that don’t break existing functionality.

> For student projects:  
> - Use **0.x.x** versions while learning and iterating (pre-1.0).  
> - Only bump to **1.0.0** once the project feels stable and is “production-ready.”
