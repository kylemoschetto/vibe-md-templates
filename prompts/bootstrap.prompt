# Bootstrap: Set Up Claude Code Starter Kit

You are setting up this Claude Code Starter Kit for a new project. Follow these steps exactly.

## CRITICAL: Enter Plan Mode First

Before doing ANYTHING else, enter plan mode. The user must see and approve the full plan before any files are created or modified.

In your plan, outline every step you will take, including:
- Which files will be copied and where
- What the final folder structure will look like

Wait for user approval before proceeding.

## Step 1: Copy Starter Permissions (Do This First)

This minimizes permission popups for the rest of setup.

1. Create the `.claude/` folder if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude
   ```

2. Copy the starter permissions file:
   ```bash
   cp templates/starter-permissions.json .claude/settings.local.json
   ```

---

## Step 2: Copy All Templates

Copy all template files to the `.claude/` folder:

```bash
cp templates/claude.md .claude/
cp templates/prd.md .claude/
cp templates/workflow.md .claude/
cp templates/infra.md .claude/
cp templates/security.md .claude/
cp templates/sbom.md .claude/
cp templates/tests.md .claude/
cp templates/changelog.md .claude/
```

---

## Step 3: Copy All Slash Commands

Create the commands folder and copy all commands:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp commands/*.md .claude/commands/
```

---

## Step 4: Initialize Beads

Set up lightweight issue tracking:

```bash
bd quickstart
```

If beads is not installed, inform the user they need to install it:
```bash
npm install -g beads-ts
```

---

## Step 5: Offer Status Line Setup

Ask the user:

> "Would you like to set up the context status line? This shows your token usage in real-time and is **highly recommended** by the template author—it significantly improves your Claude Code experience by helping you stay aware of context limits. It's also easy to remove later if you don't want it."

If yes, run `/setup-statusline` or guide them through the setup.

---

## Completion

Verify the setup:

- [ ] `.claude/` folder exists with all template files
- [ ] `.claude/commands/` folder exists with all command files
- [ ] `.claude/settings.local.json` exists (starter permissions)
- [ ] `.beads/` folder exists (from `bd quickstart`)

Then tell the user:

> "Your Claude Code Starter Kit structure is ready!
>
> **Next step:** Run the PRD setup to customize your templates:
> ```
> Paste the contents of prompts/create-prd.prompt
> ```
> Or if you prefer, you can manually edit the files in `.claude/` to add your project details.
>
> Once your PRD is set up, you can:
> - Run `/gogogo` to start a coding session
> - Run `/story` to add more features to your PRD
> - Run `bd ready` to see issues ready to work on"
